##Current Problems
- Make the Home List of posts look good..
- Rotate images in post automatically
- Make the listed things (comments and posts) look like god made them himself
- Change the active link color
- Make the rating rating systems for the posts right now
- Make a favorites addition to the database
- Make a comments addition to the database
- Pictures donâ€™t reload after you submit the comment
- When we search for notes, they end up ugly because of the expanding search results page.
- Header needs to move down to the bottom
